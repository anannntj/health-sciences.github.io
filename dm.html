    <div class="pandemic"><hr><h1>PANDEMIC</h1><hr></div>
    <div class="p1"><h1>A pandemic is defined as “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very <br>wide area,
crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a<br> large number of people”. The
classical definition includes nothing<br> about population immunity, virology or disease severity.
By this<br> definition, pandemics can be said to occur annually in each of the temperate<br>
southern and northern hemispheres, given that seasonal epidemics<br> cross international
boundaries and affect a large number<br> of people. However, seasonal epidemics are not
considered pandemics.</h1></div>

     <div class="impacts1"><h1>• Pandemics can cause significant, widespread increases in morbidity and<br> mortality and have disproportionately higher mortality impacts on LMICs.<br><br>
• Pandemics can cause economic damage through multiple channels, including<br> short-term fiscal shocks and longer-term negative shocks to economic growth.<br><br>
• Individual behavioral changes, such as fear-induced aversion to workplaces<br> and other public gathering places, are a primary cause of negative<br> shocks to economic growth during pandemics.<br><br>
• Some pandemic mitigation measures can cause significant social and economic disruption.<br><br>
• In countries with weak institutions and legacies of political instability, pandemics<br> can increase political stresses and tensions. In these contexts, outbreak<br> response measures such as quarantines have sparked violence and<br> tension between states and citizens.

There were about 5,00,000,000 deaths due the pandemic.The disease<br> was fatal and we all know that 
Now let us come to the present. There<br> is a pandemic going on right now around the world which has also proven to<br> be fatal. It has caused around 560000 deaths all across the world. The Spanish<br> flu was much more fatal than covid 19</h1></div>

    <div class="history"><hr><h1>HISTORY OF HEALTH</h1><hr></div>
    <div class="his1"><h1>The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the biomedical perspective,<br> early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; <br>health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from<br> time to time by disease. An example of such a definition of health is: "a state<br> characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity; ability to<br> perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with<br>physical, biological, psychological, and social stress".[2] Then in 1948, in a radical<br> departure from previous definitions, the World Health Organization (WHO)<br> proposed a definition that aimed higher: linking health to well-being, in terms of<br> "physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of <br>disease and infirmity".[3] Although this definition was welcomed by some<br> as being innovative, it was also criticized as being vague, excessively broad<br> and was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as<br> an impractical ideal and most discussions of health returned to the practicality of<br> the biomedical model.</h1></div>

    <div class="deter1"><h1>Lifestyle: the aggregation of personal decisions (i.e., over which the individual<br> has control) that can be said to contribute to, or cause, illness or death;<br><br>
Environmental: all matters related to health external to the human body and over<br> which the individual has little or no control;<br><br>
Biomedical: all aspects of health, physical and mental, developed within the human<br> body as influenced by genetic make-up.</h1></div>
       
       <div class="diet"><hr><h1>DIET</h1><hr></div>
       <div class="diet1"><h1>An important way to maintain your personal health is to have a healthy diet.<br> A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods<br> that provide nutrients to your body. Such nutrients give you energy and<br> keep your body running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and<br> tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e. blood pressure). Water is <br>essential for growth, reproduction and good health. Macronutrients are consumed in <br>relatively large quantities and include proteins, carbohydrates, and fats <br>and fatty acids. Micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – are consumed in relatively<br> smaller quantities, but are essential to body processes.</h1></div>

       <div class="fir"><hr><h1>SARS-COV-2</h1><hr></div>
       <div class="fir1"><h1>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the<br> strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),<br> the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>Colloquially known as simply the coronavirus, it was previously referred to by<br> its provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human <br>coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19). The World Health Organization declared<br> the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern<br> on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.</h1></div>

       <div class="sy"><hr><h1>SYMPTOMS</h1><hr></div>
       <div class="sy1"><h1>Fever is the most common symptom of COVID-19, but is highly variable in<br> severity and presentation, with some older, immunocompromised, or critically <br>ill people not having fever at all. In one study, only 44% of<br> people had fever when they presented to the hospital, while 89% went on<br> to develop fever at some point during their hospitalization.Other common<br> symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of<br> breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains. Symptoms such<br> as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.<br> Less common symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, and skin lesions.</h1></div> 

       <div class="treatment1"><h1>Azithromycin: This must be the most widely prescribed and misused<br> antibiotic in this pandemic. Azithromycin, as with all other antibiotics, <br>does not work in viral infections. Antibiotics are only warranted <br>in patients who have evidence of a secondary bacterial infection<br> as some hospitalised patients will have in the later stages of their disease. Indiscriminate<br> use (as was the case even before the pandemic) in the hope that they will prevent <br>bacterial infection only worsens antibiotic resistance, to which <br>India is a frequent contributor.</h1></div>
